This repository list most of all important and publishable projects carried out during my university studies at the IUT of Lannion and during internship in the French Army.

__Projects list :__

- Tracked Robot (University Project)
  > This project was carried out during the third semester of my university studies, it consisted of setting up and programming a Robot using Raspberry Py. During this project, my partner and I chose to use a tracked robot and completed this project by getting a robot that communicates via an HMI using an UDP client on a computer and a UDP server installed in the robot that can be controlled by an Xbox One controller communicating with the computer and allowing direction and speed control functionalities.
  
- 2nd Year Internship Project
  > This project was set up as part of an internship within the French army at the the __[École des Transmissions et du Numérique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_transmissions)__ located in Cesson-Sévigné, in order to raise awareness and educate students and employees via a already existing vulnerability demonstrator. The vulnerability demonstrator consist of the presentation of cybersecurity modules to expose the dangers of internet and poor computer hygiene. My main work consist in a "proof of concept" module allowing the presentation of various types of attack and their implementation. Such as Site Hoover, WIFI Hotspot Deauthentication Attack, DNS Spoofing and Unusual QRCode Phishing Method.
