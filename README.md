# University Projects Repository
This repository lists most of the important and publishable projects carried out during my university studies at the IUT of Lannion and during my internship in the French Army.

__Projects list :__

- Tracked Robot Project
  > This project was carried out during the third semester of my university studies, it consisted of setting up and programming a Robot using Raspberry Py. During this project, my partner and I chose to use a tracked robot and completed this project by getting a robot that communicates via an HMI using an UDP client on a computer and a UDP server installed in the robot that can be controlled by an Xbox One controller communicating with the computer and allowing direction and speed control functionalities.
  
- 2nd Year Internship Project
  > This project was set up as part of an internship within the French army at the the __[École des Transmissions et du Numérique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_transmissions)__ located in Cesson-Sévigné, in order to raise awareness and educate students and employees via an already existing vulnerability demonstrator. The vulnerability demonstrator is a presentation room with hacking specialized equipment and consist of the presentation of cybersecurity modules by teachers to expose the dangers of internet and poor computer hygiene. One of my main tasks during this internship consist in producing a "proof of concept" QRPhishing module allowing the presentation of various types of attack and their implementation. Such as Site Hoover, WIFI Hotspot Deauthentication Attack, DNS Spoofing and Unusual QRCode Phishing Method. (I also worked on a wiki for cybersecurity modules for new teachers, some other smaller cybersecurity modules and some quality of life modification added to the vulnerability demonstrator to help the teachers presentations) You can look at my internship report to have a better preview of my work.
