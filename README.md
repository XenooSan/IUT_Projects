- Tracked Robot
  > This project was carried out during the third semester of my university studies, it consisted of setting up and programming a Robot using Raspberry Py. During this project, my partner and I chose to use a tracked robot and completed this project by getting a robot that communicates via an HMI using an UDP client on a computer and a UDP server installed in the robot that can be controlled by an Xbox One controller communicating with the computer and allowing direction and speed control functionality.
